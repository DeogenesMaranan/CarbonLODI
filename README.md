<p align="justify">
Climate change is a concerning issue caused by long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. The increasing greenhouse gas emissions from individuals, corporations, businesses, and industries have led to harmful effects on the environment, such as heat, drought, and insect outbreaks. It is crucial to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate these effects. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
A carbon footprint refers to the greenhouse gases produced by an individual in their daily life, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. By tracking their carbon footprint, people can understand the environmental impact of their activities and lifestyle choices. Minimizing carbon footprint is essential for achieving a sustainable lifestyle and a better future.  
</p>

<p align="justify">
A carbon footprint calculator measures emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). It includes a calculator that determines the amount of carbon emissions produced. Users input their transportation, energy usage, diet, consumption habits, and housing factors into the calculator. The calculator also provides suggestions for carbon offsetting and emissions reduction based on the user's inputs. Ultimately, it presents results and analysis to raise awareness about the impact of carbon emissions and encourage environmentally conscious actions.

This program will benefit the following: 

🏫 __Academe.__ This program will help the academe to monitor, regulate, and control the carbon footprint of each part of the academe.  
🏢 __Government.__ This program will help the government to ensure emissions in a city or country do not exceed a designated carbon footprint limit.  
  👨‍🎓 __Students.__ This program will aim for students to change their primary habits in their daily lives (such as eating less meat) to help make an impact.
