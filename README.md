<h3 align = "center">🖋 INRODUCTION 🖋</h3>

<p align="justify">
We all know that climate change is a distinctly alarming matter. As we live in a modern contemporary world, individuals, corporations, businesses, companies, and many more have ever-increasing greenhouse gasses. Reducing one's carbon footprint is one approach to lessen carbon emissions.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To do this, one must track their carbon footprint and determine where one may make changes to lower their carbon emissions. People can better comprehend the effects of their everyday activities and lifestyle decisions by keeping track of their carbon footprint. They can then take action to lessen those effects. Thus, if we achieve a minimized carbon footprint and emissions, we firmly believe we can attain a more sustainable lifestyle alongside a more promising future.
</p>

<p align="justify">
A carbon footprint calculator is measured in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). It contains standard features such as a calculator, which calculates the number of carbon emissions produced. The carbon footprint calculator requires the user to input their mode of transportation, energy usage, diet, consumption habits, and miscellaneous housings.
</p>


<p align="justify">
Moreover, the program offers suggestions regarding carbon offsetting and emissions reduction related to the user's previous inputs. Lastly, the carbon footprint calculator provides results and analysis to help people realize the impact of their carbon emissions and how they could take ethical steps for the environment.
